# How to run the code

#### Method 1 - babashka
Install babashka (a minimal native binary which executes
clojure code) from:

https://github.com/babashka/babashka

and run with: 

```
~> bb src/aoc/day_09.clj
```

while in the `clojure` directory.


### Method 2 - clojure on the JVM
Install clojure from: 

https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started

and run with: 

```
~> clj src/aoc/day_09.clj
```

while in the `clojure` directory.


### Note on the ./data directory
This directory will on my local machine contain my personal input data 
files for the Advent of Code problems. I will however not publish these
as the AOC creators encourage users to not do that.
